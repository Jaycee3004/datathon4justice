Location/Address: [WIA 1528] NORTH HOOSAC RD
/ Narrative:
 Wife calling to report that her husband received numerous
phone calls two days ago that is most likely a scam and they
are looking for advice on how to proceed. Because of how
convincing they were he did get scared into giving them his
Social Security Number and home address. He did hang up at
one point after being on the phone for a long time. Then he
said he got a call back and they said they were from the
Williamstown Police department. He didn't think that was
true because of the accent that they had. There maybe have
: then been 16 or so calls that he didn't answer because he
was teaching.
RP provided information for ID Theft from Mass.Gov and the
IRS.
Any advice or places to point us would be great.

 - Narrative:
I spoke with Lafleur via telephone, who reported Turning
Point employee, Angela Guzzi, is refusing to give him his
pain medication, because he will not turn over his car keys
to her. Lafleur states that Guzzi is upset because he
admitted to her that he drove his vehicle from his home to
the mailboxes in Pines Lodge. Lafleur was advised of his
| options and decided, at this time, to not pursue the matter
until he can speak with a Brien Center supervisor tomorrow.
| While speaking with Lefleur, he was calm and cooperative and
indicated he has no suicidal ideations. Lefleur was also
advised not to drive a motor vehicle.

WCSS was initially calling to report an MVA. I arrived on |
| the scene and met with WCSS Ofc. Mazzacco Jr. Incident
involved a college-owned golf cart, operated on college
property by an authorized college affiliated individual, who
had reported the incident to WCSS and walked to another
college building. The operator had struck a concrete wall
. owned. by the college. I advised Ofc. Mazzacco , I would log
| the matter; however, no further WPD action was needed.
