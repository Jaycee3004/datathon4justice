CP complaining about management saying that they are
harassing her. CP states they raised her and a few others
rent by 4% and all the other tenants 2-3%. Also when CP confronted management they sent a sheriff to give her a
cease and desist. Feels like they may hurt her or slash her tires in the future. CP is looking at other property to move to. CP would like this logged.

Reports his 11 year old son was walking along the road at 1700 hrs. when a black suv slowed and occupants started
yelling racial slurs out the window. Caller recognizes, due to the lapse in time and lack of any further description, nothing can be done at this time. Would just like a log note in case it happens again or to someone else. Has advised his son, if it should happen again, to call right away and
attempt to get a plate and/or better vehicle.

Party put something that was 'smoking in the bathroom trash then left. RP inhales some of the smoke and is concerned.
Upon arrival did observe a slight odor of something that may have been burning, very light smoke coming from the top of the trash can. The trash bag was taken out and nothing
appeared to be burning inside the bag. After a few minutes
the smoke, odor discipated. Unknown at this time what may have caused the issue.

INVESTIGATED/ REPORT
While doing checks, discovered passenger side window of car had been smashed with a large boulder which was now lying on drivers seat. Unknown if anything is missing. Not sure if related but noted a Caravan type car as it passed my cruiser
at 4.2mph in a 35mph zone at the flashing speed sign near Neathawks. It tapped brakes twice and kept going toward Vt.

Party at station to ir.ake complaint of loose dogs not under voice control or on leashes. RP states she goes for a daily morning run, with her dog, at 615am on the Stone Hill Trail and has been running into a unknown male party who refuses
to control his two dogs. RP states her dog is very anxious around other animals and begins to panic. RP states while running this past week the unknown male party continuously allows his two dogs to run up to her. This then causes her dog to panic and drag her into the bushes. RP has asked male party to better control his two dogs in which he replies
"take your dog off the leash" and "get out of here."

call Ii 19-12747, he found the apartment to be messy and cluttered. was concerned because two children were also at the residence. •■■iiiiiiiiii stated Chief
instructed him to call the police can follow-up with Health Inspector
I advised if he was concerned about the children, as a mandated reporter, he would be required to immediately file a verbal report with the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families (DCF), and submit a written report to DCF within 48-hours. I provided -
with the weekend contact number for DCFand advised
him the FD can also contact - directly if they wish. Before disconnecting, confirmed the children were not in an immediate safety situation; he just found the apartment needed to be in better order if children were living there.
